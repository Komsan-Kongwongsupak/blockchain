# Blockchain
This project is a Python-based blockchain simulator that illustrates how blockchain technology works, from the addition of financial transactions to safeguarding data manipulation after the creation of blocks in the system. The main objective of this project is to demonstrate my skills in implementing object-oriented programming in Python and my fundamental understanding of blockchain mechanism.
### Installation
To run the program, clone the repository into your PC, navigate to the project directory, and run the main.py file.
### Usage
The main.py file is the primary program file in the project, where you can immediately access all the blockchain components, which have been programmed as classes in other Python files. The file is designed to let you play around with the blockchain components and modify the code as per your requirements.
### UML Diagram
There is a UML class diagram in the project directory named UML-class-diagram.pdf. It is a visual representation of the classes in the project and how they interact with each other. Reading this file will give you a better understanding of the project before running the program.
### Contact Information
If you are interested in discussing programming-related topics or have any questions about the project, feel free to contact me at komsan.kongwongsupak@gmail.com. I am always happy to share my knowledge and learn from others.
