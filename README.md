# Blockchain

This project imitates how blockchain works based on my insights using Python. It contains "Block" class, of which the constructed objects store the transaction as the main data, and "Blockchain" class, of which the instance acts like a chain that stores a set of Block objects.

The idea of this project was initiated in 2019, when I was practicing object-oriented programming in my club named "Turing Club". As a programming project concept created by the senior member of the club, which is the implementation of blockchain's principle in object-oriented programming paradigm, I was told to use Java as the programming language at that time, and I did complete that version of this project. Unfortunately, I did not publicise it here. Three years later, I looked for that project and could not find it anymore (apologise for my unprofessional practice ;v;). Therefore, I decided to rebuild it since this is a really outstanding showcase project that I have done. Besides, I am more experienced in Python as the main programming language than in Java. Finally, I came up with the new version of blockchain project, of which the README file is the place where you currently are, using Python.

Special thanks for information sources that give me clear understanding about blockchain's principle.
